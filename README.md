<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Writing cover letters are some of the most tedious part of the employment process for any prospective applicant.

Writing and editing a single page from scratch could take at least 30 minutes to an hour; which is time that could be better spent browsing for more job postings for said applicant.

This project aims to lessen the time spent by applicants on writing cover letters by leveraging generative AI.

I would not have been able to complete this project without the help of this wonderful guide: 

* [TKDocs - Modern Tk Best Practices][Tkinter-url] - Guide for Tkinter

While there are many online guides about how to create GUI's using Pythons built in Tkinter, "TKDocs - Modern Tk Best Practices" provides a comprehensive and detailed guide on creating a modern and responsive GUI. 

Please do give them a read as they have helped me as they potentially may help you~
