Dear human resource analyst of {x}, I have wanted to be involved in the industry of the company that you are employed by for a very long time. After browsing through your companyâ€™s job page, I have found that one of the positions you offer has the sort of work that I am interested in pursuing as a long-term career path.

In my most recent work experience, I worked as a reference data analyst for the terms and conditions data team of MSCI Hong Kong Limited. In my role, the tools that I use on a daily basis are SQL (oracle) in order to query data from our database, UNIX to monitor the Autosys Jobs and the logs of the scripts that normalizes our data into our database, as well as PowerBI to monitor the quality of our data as well as Proprietary Quality Assurance frameworks. I am also able to program python and have completed a data visualization project with PowerBI and Python windows task scheduler.

Although this profession is not within the traditional scope of my field of work (Finance) I am still intrigued and eager to learn about the role I am applying for, and with this in mind I feel that I may be a strong candidate for the position that I have applied for as it is the perfect role for me to further my career. However, although if you feel that I may be a better fit for a different sort of position, I would still be very open to applying for it. I hope to hear a reply from you soon.

Sincerely,
            """
